## Description
This project built a machine learning model to suggest text based on an initial text. The model was coded in Python. The model is running in a public service. Sitecore consumes those services using javascript.

It is common for many electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets to get a smart keyboard. What does it mean? Devices can suggest words or frasses while users are writing text messages. So, what had happened with the old editors for Content Manager software? Common rich editors do not get smart behavior to help their users.

This project's main idea is to add simple functionality to suggest content authors text or frasses to add in their content. Since here, new possibilities are opened to add new functionalities to help content authors. For example. Rich text editors can get an option to analyze the text to predict what kind of sentiment their text produces.

All information related to the text is valuable for content authors to improve their quality content.
